//Tips//
/*
1.Flickering is normal when EPD is performing a full screen update to clear ghosting from the previous image so to ensure better clarity and legibility for the new image.
2.There will be no flicker when EPD performs a partial refresh.
3.Please make sue that EPD enters sleep mode when refresh is completed and always leave the sleep mode command. Otherwise, this may result in a reduced lifespan of EPD.
4.Please refrain from inserting EPD to the FPC socket or unplugging it when the MCU is being powered to prevent potential damage.)
5.Re-initialization is required for every full screen update.
6.When porting the program, set the BUSY pin to input mode and other pins to output mode.
